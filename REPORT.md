## Implementation

### Steps:
1. Created a simple **`index.html`** file containing BMI calculator code.  
2. Wrote a **`Dockerfile`** to serve the HTML file using **nginx** web server.  
3. Built the Docker image using the command:  
   ```sh
   docker build -t bmi-app .
   
  Ran the container using:
   docker run -d -p 8080:80 bmi-app


  Accessed the BMI Calculator in browser at:
   http://localhost:8080


Dockerfile used:
FROM nginx:alpine
COPY index.html /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html

Source Code
   The complete source code is available in this repository:
